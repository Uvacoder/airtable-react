# Testing pure react with axios (HTTP request) on airtable vs Gatsby graphQL on airtable

I just wanted to know how Gatsby & graphQL capability will be able to perform when connected to Airtable to react & axios:

1. Get data from Airtable and render in your browser;
2. Filter the data;
3. Change the data structure in airtable;

More importantly, this experiment pretends to understand the difference in performance between Gatsby & graphQL when compared to react & axios as well as get a better sense for the code required to implement both solutions
